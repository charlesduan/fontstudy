\sectionname{Numerical Analysis}

Because the measured parameters have generally the same semantic meanings as the
parameters for the original Computer Modern programs, it is possible to compare
the measured values with the hand-chosen ones to see how accurately, from a
numerical standpoint, the generated fonts should match. We can do so with the
original Computer Modern fonts, as those parameters are readily available.
Additionally, the parameter sets provided by Alan Hoenig's \emph{MathKit}
provide us with more comparison values.

Naturally, numerical comparisons cannot tell us the aesthetic success of the
generated fonts. Following this analysis are numerous visual samples of
generated math fonts, which the reader may inspect to assess the degree of
success of MathGen.
