\sectionname{Tekton}

Tekton is a font designed to mimic an architect's handwriting. It exhibits a
very consistent stroke width and an unusual upward angle to many of its letters,
such as the capital ``T'' and ``E.''

The generated math fonts capture the stroke width very well, and the fonts look
very much like the original roman characters. However, the slight flares at the
tips of letters, mimicking small blobs of ink from a stopped pen, are not
captured, as they are an unusual display feature of the font. This is not so
obvious at small sizes, and it does not detract from the compatibility of the
math characters.

More distracting is the lack of the upward slant of the characters. The
horizontal bars of the characters $\Gamma$ and $\Sigma$ do not fit well with the
slanted F and E. This is unfortunate, but there isn't much that can be done
about it in any general manner.

On the whole, though, the generated font is very compatible with Tekton. As this
font seems like one that might be used for informal mathematics documents, it is
good that a compatible math font can be generated.
