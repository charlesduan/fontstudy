\sectionname{Courier}

Courier is a monospaced font designed to look like a typewriter. It displays
very consistent stroke width and rounded serifs (in the version distributed with
GhostScript).

The appearance of the generated letters is satisfactory given the unusual
challenge of measuring a monospaced font, as the dimensions are not as one would
expect (e.g. the serif jut is substantially different between the ``I'' and
``M''). However, the programs capture the necessary features nicely, and the
generated fonts match well with the original text.

However, there is one stylistic element that makes them slightly incompatible.
Because Courier is so light, serifs are placed on practically every terminal
point of every letter, including the top of the capital ``A.'' However, the
Computer Modern lowercase Greek letters have almost no serifs. As a result, the
lowercase letters tend to look like ``stick figures'' or simple line drawings.
While that is not problematic for mathematical formulas, where Greek characters
are interspersed with roman, the generated Greek fonts would be highly
unsuitable for text, more so with the Courier mock math fonts than other
generated fonts.
