\sectionname{Futura}

Futura is a geometric sans serif font, drawn out of simple geometric shapes such
as circles and triangles. It shares many properties with Avant Garde, but it
differs in one key respect: Futura has an unusually low x-height. Early tests
revealed that this property made several revisions to the character designs
necessary; in particular, the upper hook of the $\delta$ was drastically
modified to fit properly.

Although most of the letters look appropriate, the small x-height and
correspondingly large ascender height (the increase in height of letters such as
``l'' and ``d'') cause several of the characters with ascenders to look oddly
long. In particular, the cross-strokes of $\phi$ and $\psi$ look somewhat
disproportionate. It may be worthwhile setting a cap on their height to offset
this odd appearance.

The uppercase Greek letters are slightly disproportionate in width---the
$\Theta$ is too narrow and the $\Gamma$ too wide---but on the whole they match
well in appearance. In particular, the $\Delta$ and $\Lambda$ characters display
the characteristic sharp tip of the ``A'' and ``V.''
