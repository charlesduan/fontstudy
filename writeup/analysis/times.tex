\sectionname{Times Roman}

Times Roman is one of the most popular fonts in common use today. One reason for
its popularity is its very simple, traditional design, which makes it a good
candidate for font measurement.

The resulting math fonts match very well with the text font. Unexpectedly, the
Times italic font is somewhat lighter than the upright, so the Greek letters
match better with the upright text than the italic. The capital Greek letters
match practically perfectly; in particular the hairline-thin serifs are captured
properly.

Because the Times fonts are so commonly used with the Computer Modern math
fonts, it is worth noting why they are so \emph{incompatible}. The Times fonts
are significantly darker than Computer Modern; in particular the hairlines are
much more prominent. However, the serifs in Times Roman are much finer and less
prominent than those in Computer Modern. The x-height matches fairly well, but
the capital letters in Times are smaller than those in Computer Modern.
