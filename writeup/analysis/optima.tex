\sectionname{Optima}

Optima is a ``humanistic'' sans serif font, named such because it takes many
features from the design of serif fonts. Optima is unusual for its visible
stroke contrast and its very subtle calligraphic styling, evident in the slight
flaring of some of the thinner strokes.

The math fonts are able to capture much of the elegance of Optima, in particular
its stroke contrast. However, because the programs assume a consistent width for
strokes, the generated letters do not capture the slight flaring that occurs, so
they do not appear as ``calligraphic.'' The subtle width difference is most
noticeable in the uppercase $\Lambda$, when compared to an uppercase ``A.'' At
low resolutions or small sizes this is not too significant, though.

Surprisingly, the shapes of the Computer Modern letters work very well with
Optima. In particular, after the modifications to the routines that make the
small loops on the $\beta$, $\zeta$, and $\xi$, they match very well with the
text, and the $\delta$ is unexpectedly elegant.
