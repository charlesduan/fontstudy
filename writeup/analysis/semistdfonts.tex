\sectionname{Semi-Standard Fonts}

Many fonts fall in between the categories of standard text fonts and display
fonts. Such fonts generally exhibit the normal qualities of text fonts assumed
by MathGen but also contain unique, unmeasurable qualities of appearance that
cannot be easily duplicated. The question then becomes how distracting the lack
of those distinctive qualities becomes when combining the text font with those
qualities with a generated math font lacking them but similar in other aspects.

We look at three such semi-standard typefaces as examples. Palatino is in most
respects a standard text font, but it was designed to mimic a chiseled pen.
Tekton is designed to look like an architect's handwriting, but its strokes are
consistent enough for MathGen to duplicate its overall appearance well. Tiffany
also follows the general conventions for a standard text font, but it also
includes large flourishes at the ends of many letters, giving it an unusual
character.

The overall conclusion, at least in the author's opinion, is that while the
generated math fonts lack the distinctive qualities of the original fonts, they
are nonetheless compatible and acceptable for use. Those distinctive features
augment the aesthetic quality of the text font, but they are not noticeably
missed when not present in the Greek or mathematical symbol text.
