\sectionname{Sans Serif Fonts}

As the original math fonts were originally designed as serif fonts---the sans
serif roman designs were tacked on after the original programs were
written---the production of quality sans serif math fonts presents a new
challenge for the reworked Computer Modern font programs and MathGen.

To ensure good coverage of the general space of sans serif fonts, we select from
several different styles of sans serif type. The geometric style utilizes simple
shapes such as circles and triangles; Avant Garde and Futura are the two
examples tested. The grotesque or gothic style, exemplified by Helvetica, is
designed for simplicity and clarity. Finally, humanistic sans serif fonts
utilize elements of serif font design to achieve elegance and readability;
Optima is a humanistic sans serif font that we test.

Finally, Hardwood is a display-like sans serif font that exhibits several
unusual display-like qualities. The generated math fonts for Hardwood reveal
many of the successes and limitations of MathGen's use with sans serif fonts.
