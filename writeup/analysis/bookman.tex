\sectionname{Bookman}

Bookman was designed to be a highly legible typeface for books, modeled after
Caslon but with larger x-height and width and less prominent serifs. Its
no-nonsense, highly traditional style make it an excellent candidate for
automatic math font generation.

The generated fonts capture many of the key features of Bookman. As expected,
the stem and hairline widths are appropriate, as are the x-height and average
letter width. The highly flared beak on the letter ``F'' is also mimicked in the
``$\Gamma$'' character, although not perfectly---the base of the beak is angled
in the ``F'' but flat in the ``$\Gamma$,'' as Computer Modern assumes that the
tip of the beak is always flat. However, this is not too disconcerting.
