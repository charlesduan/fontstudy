\sectionname{Hardwood}

Hardwood is a sans serif font designed in an art deco style. Its main
characteristics are a large x-height, very consistent stroke width, and fairly
narrow characters.

Naturally the generated characters capture all three of these qualities well.
Hardwood's characters do have somewhat non-traditional widths, so some of the
letters are narrower than expected (in particular $\rho$, which should be almost
as wide as a ``p'').

Because Hardwood is only available in an upright form, the Greek letters are not
slanted. This demonstrates the fact that the Greek letters really aren't meant
to be drawn in an upright style. The $\lambda$, $\delta$, $\gamma$, and other
characters extend too far to the left; this would not be noticeable if they were
slanted to the right.
