\sectionname{Display Fonts}

The following fonts deviate greatly from the assumptions that MathGen makes
about letter shapes. As a result, many of the measurements taken from them are
erroneous or unreasonable, and the fonts produced match much less well than
those generated from traditionally-shaped typefaces.

These examples are useful for two reasons. First, they demonstrate the
limitations of MathGen, as examples of what cannot be easily measured or
imitated. Second, they demonstrate what MathGen will do in such ``emergency''
cases of fonts that fail to meet the assumptions of letter shapes. It is
noteworthy that (after some debugging) MathGen may produce highly unnatural
results with these fonts, but it will not fail.
