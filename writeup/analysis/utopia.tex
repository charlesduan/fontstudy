\sectionname{Utopia}

Utopia is a text font much like New Century Schoolbook or Times Roman. Because
of its very standard appearance, the generated math fonts look very compatible
with it.

Unsurprisingly, the stem widths match well, and the font generally looks
acceptable. One odd quality is the unusually high value of the \emph{superness}
parameter, causing the circular bowls to appear squarish. It seems that the
parameter is almost over-exaggerated, with the $\phi$ letter appearing more
square than circle. However, the squareness works well for characters such as
$\alpha$ and $\delta$.
