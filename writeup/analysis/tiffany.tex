\sectionname{Tiffany}

Tiffany is an unusual text font, exhibiting extreme stem thickness contrast and
humorous serifs. The generated math fonts capture the stem contrast beautifully,
and they exhibit some of the unusual qualities of the serifs, such as the
unusually large angle of the upper serif of the ``F''. However, the overdone
flare at the top of the serif isn't captured. However, that seems to be the only
unusual quality of Tiffany, and all of the other letters, in particular the
lowercase Greek, match very nicely.
