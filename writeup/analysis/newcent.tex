\sectionname{New Century Schoolbook}

New Century Schoolbook is the typeface that is most similar in style to Computer
Modern. Both are ``modern'' typefaces, exhibiting strong stroke contrast and
vertical stress, but they are also both designed for readability over lengthy
passages. Interestingly, though, many features of New Century Schoolbook are
very different from those of Computer Modern although the general shapes are
similar: the x-height is much higher and the letters are much darker than in
Computer Modern.

Because of the similarity in shapes, the generated math fonts match practically
perfectly with the text fonts. Stylistically, the only major difference is that
the $\kappa$ character terminates with a bulb while the $k$ has a loop as the
upper diagonal. The uppercase Greek letters are virtually indistinguishable from
the originals.
