\sectionname{Automated Measurement of Text Fonts}

The task of producing an automated mechanism for measuring qualities of text
fonts is separated into two tasks. First, a library of simple routines for
assessing general qualities of the shapes of characters is needed. That library
should provide all of the necessary functions for one to perform measurements on
the characters in a font. Second, we must use that library to write routines to
measure the necessary values for our font generation system (i.e., the sixty-two
parameters that define the Computer Modern fonts).

We begin by discussing the requirements and implementation of the general
measurement library. We then consider how that library was used in measuring
several parameters from a font.
