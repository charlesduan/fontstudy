\sectionname{Changes to the Computer Modern Programs}

Although the programs that generate the Computer Modern fonts are touted as
producing high-quality fonts for any reasonable set of parameters,
experimentation has shown that, in particular with the mathematical and Greek
symbols, much work was necessary to make this claim true. Since the goal of
MathGen is to produce compatible math fonts for a wide range of typefaces, the
original font programs had to be improved substantially in several areas.

Simplest among these changes were several bug fixes to errors in the font
programs. However, many of the changes were design decisions, altering the
overall look of the font to be more compatible with certain classes of text
fonts. Finally, additional parameters were introduced, some to ensure greater
compatibility with the text font (in which cases the parameters were measured)
and others to allow the user greater control over the generated font's
appearance (in which cases the parameters are specified by the end user).
